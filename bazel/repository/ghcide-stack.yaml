# This file pins a Stackage snapshot whose only purpose is to build a version of
# ghcide suitable for the GHC version used in this repository. At present the
# GHC version used in this repository is 8.6.5. This file thus takes its
# contents from the `stack.yaml` available in the ghcide GitHub repository. If
# e.g. you wish to use GHC 8.8.X, then you should take the contents of the
# `stack88.yaml` file and tune appropriately.
resolver: nightly-2019-09-21
# PATCH: In the ghcide `stack.yaml` file, these packages were under
# `extra-deps`. Due to how we use snapshots with Bazel, need to move these under
# `packages` here.
